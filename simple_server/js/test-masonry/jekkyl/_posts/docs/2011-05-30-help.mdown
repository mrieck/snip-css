jQuery Masonry is a fairly popular plugin. Chances are your issue has already been encountered by someone else.

## Reporting bugs and issues

[Report bugs and issues on GitHub](http://github.com/desandro/masonry/issues). 

### Guidelines {: #issues-guidelines}

+ Look over open and closed issues before submitting yours.
+ Add a link to a live site with the bug. If the project is confidential, try re-creating it in [jsFiddle](http://jsfiddle.net).

The issues tracker is for bugs and issues -- when Masonry doesn't work as expected. It is not for implementation issues -- when you are having trouble setting up Masonry. Consider a [Support License](http://metafizzy.co/#support-license) for implementation issues. If you're not sure, go ahead and submit an issue.

## Support license

If you've tried everything and would really like to get my eyes looking at your code, you can purchase a [Support License from Metafizzy](http://metafizzy.co/#support-license).

## Unloaded media and overlapping

The number one issue that pops up is overlapping content. This is most likely due to unloaded images.

### imagesLoaded plugin

The easiest solution is to use the <a href="intro.html#imagesloaded_plugin">imagesLoaded plugin</a> as shown in the intro. This small plugin will trigger a callback after all the images in the specified content have been loaded.

[See Demo: Images](../demos/images.html).

### Inline dimensions

Or you can specify the width and height of images inline.

{% highlight html %}

<img src="img-file.jpg" width="280" height="160" />

{% endhighlight %}

If youâ€™re using a PHP-based CMS, you can use the [getimagesize](http://php.net/manual/en/function.getimagesize.php) function.

### $(window).load()

Another solution is to initialize Masonry inside `$(window).load()` instead of `$(document).ready()`. This will trigger Masonry after all the media on the page has loaded -- images, fonts, external scripts and stylesheets, etc. This method is not recommended as it can cause ugly wait times.

{% highlight javascript %}

$(window).load(function(){
  $('#container').masonry({
    // options...
  });
});

{% endhighlight %}

## @font-face fonts

Both Typekit and Google WebFont Loader provide font events to control scripts based on how fonts are loaded. 

+ [Typekit font events](http://blog.typekit.com/2010/10/18/more-control-with-typekits-font-events/)
+ [Google WebFont Loader: Events](http://code.google.com/apis/webfonts/docs/webfont_loader.html#Events)

## Filtering

Filtering with Masonry is officially unsupported as of v2.0. Use [Isotope](http://isotope.metafizzy.co) instead. Isotope shares a majority Masonry's features. It also has additional powerful features like filtering and sorting built right in, so you probably won't be missing any functionality.

## Getting data

You can access all the options and properties in a Masonry instance using the `.data()` method with the namespace `'masonry'`.

{% highlight javascript %}

$('#container').data('masonry');

{% endhighlight %}
